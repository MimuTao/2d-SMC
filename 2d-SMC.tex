% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
	This paper is concerned with the problem of asynchronous sliding mode control (SMC) for two-dimensional (2D) discrete-time Markov jump systems, which is described by Roesser model.  A hidden Markov model (HHM) is introduced to describe the asynchronization which appears between the designed sliding model controller and the original system. Based on the constructed 2D sliding surface, an asynchronous 2D-SMC law is designed. The Lyapunov function and Linear matrix inequality technique are utilized to establish sufficient conditions of the asymptotic mean square stability with a prescribed $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance for the closed-loop 2D system. Moreover, the reachability of the constructed 2D sliding surface is ensured simultaneously. Then, the asynchronous 2D-SMC law can be obtained by solving a  convex optimization problem.  Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous 2D-SMC law design method.

\section{Introduction}
	This part is introduciton.


\section{Preliminaries} \label{priliminaries}
	In this paper, we consider the following two-dimensional Markov jump systems in Roesser model:
	\begin{equation} \label{system-equation}
	\left\{
		\begin{array}{lr}
			\begin{split}
				\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} &= A_{r(i,j)}x(i,j)+E_{r(i,j)}w(i,j)\\
										&+B_{r(i,j)}[(u(i,j)+f(x(i,j),r(i,j))]
			\end{split}\\
			\begin{split}
				y(i,j) = C_{r(i,j)}x(i,j)+D_{r(i,j)}w(i,j)
			\end{split}
		\end{array}
	\right.
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} = \begin{bmatrix}
			x^{h}(i+1,j)\\
			x^{v}(i,j+1)
		\end{bmatrix}, \ 
		x(i, j) = \begin{bmatrix}
		x^{h}(i,j)\\
		x^{v}(i,j)
		\end{bmatrix}          
	\end{equation*}
	$x^{h}(i,h)\in \mathbb{R}^{n_h}$ and $x^{v}(i,h)\in \mathbb{R}^{n_v}$ represent horizontal and vertical states respectively, $u(i,j) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_u}$ and $y(i,j) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_y}$ represent the controlled input and output respectively, and $w(i,j) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_w}$ represents the exogenous disturbance which belongs to $\ell_{2}\{[0,\infty),[0,\infty)\}$. $A_{r(i,j)}$,$B_{r(i,j)}$,$C_{r(i,j)}$,$D_{r(i,j)}$ and $E_{r(i,j)}$ represent the time-varying system matrices, all of which are real known constant matrices with appropriate dimensions. Besides, we assume that the matrix $B_{r(i,j)}$ is full column rank for each $r(i,j)\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$, that is, rank($B_{r(i,j)}$)$=n_u$. The nonlinear function $f(x(i,j),r(i,j))$ satisfying the following property:
	\begin{equation}\label{nonlinear-func}
		\|f(x(i,j),r(i,j)\| \leq \delta_{r(i,j)}\|x(i,j)\|
	\end{equation}
	where $\delta_{r(i,j)}$ is a known scalar, $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector. The parameter $r(i,j)$ takes values in a finite set $\mathcal{N}_{1}=\{1,2...,N_{1} \}$ with transition probability matrix $\varLambda = \{\lambda_{k\tau}\}$, and the related transition probability from mode $k$ to mode $\tau$ is given by 
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			&\Pr\{r(i+1,j)=\tau|r(i,j)=k\}\\
		    =&\Pr\{r(i,j+1)=\tau|r(i,j)=k\}=\lambda_{k\tau},\  \forall k,\tau \in \mathcal{N}_{1}
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	where $\lambda_{k\tau}\in[0,1]$, for all $k, \tau\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$, and $\sum_{\tau=1}^{N_1}\lambda_{k\tau}=1$ for every mode $k$.
	
	We define the boundary condition ($X_{0},\Gamma_{0}$) of system \eqref{system-equation}, as follows:
	\begin{equation} \label{boundary-condition}
	\left\{
		\begin{array}{lr}
			\begin{split}
				X_{0} &= \{x^{h}(0,j),x^{v}(i,0)|\ i,j = 0,1,2...\}\\
				\varGamma_{0} &= \{r(0,j), r(i,0)|\ i,j = 0,1,2... \}
			\end{split}
		\end{array}
	\right.
	\end{equation}
	And the corresponding zero boundary condition is assumed as $x^{h}(0,j) =0, x^{v}(i,0)=0, i,j =0,1,2...$. Besides, we further impose following assumption on $X_{0}$.
	
	\begin{assumption}\label{boundary-assumptin}
	 	The boundary condition $X_{0}$ satisfies:
	 	\begin{equation}
	 		\lim\limits_{L\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\Big\{\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}(\|x^{h}(0,\ell)\|^{2}+ \|x^{v}(\ell,0)\|^{2})\Big\} < \infty
	 	\end{equation}
	 	where $\mathbb{E}\{\cdot\}$ stands for mathematical expectation.
	\end{assumption}
	
	In practical applications, the complete information of $r(i,j)$ can not always be available to the controller. Hence, in this paper, the hidden Markov model $(r(i,j),\sigma(i,j),\varLambda,\varPsi)$ as in [refto] is introduced to characterize the asynchronous phenomenon between the controller and the system. The parameter $\sigma(i,j)$, refers to controller mode, takes values in another finite set $\mathcal{N}_{2} = \{1,2...N_{2}\}$, and satisfies the conditional probability matrix $\varPsi=\{\mu_{ks}\}$ with conditional mode transition probabilities
	\begin{equation}
		\Pr\{\sigma(i,j)=s|r(i,j)=k\}=\mu_{ks} %\forall  k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}, s\in\mathcal{N}_{2}
	\end{equation}
	where $\mu_{ks}\in[0,1]$ for all $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}, s\in\mathcal{N}_{2}$, and $\sum_{s=1}^{N2}\mu_{ks} = 1$ for any mode $k$.
	
	Next, the definitions of  asymptotically mean square stable and $H_{\infty}$ performance for 2D systems will be given in Definition \ref{mean-square-stable} and Definition \ref{H_infty-performance}, respectively.
	
	\begin{definition}\label{mean-square-stable}
	The 2D Markov jump system \eqref{system-equation} with $w(i,j)\equiv0$ is said to be asymptotically mean square stable if the following holds:
	\begin{equation}\label{AMSS}
			\lim\limits_{i+j\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\{\|x(i,j)\|^{2}\} = 0
	\end{equation}
	for any boundary condition $X_{0}$ with Assumption \ref{boundary-assumptin}.
	\end{definition}

%	\begin{definition}\label{mean-square-stable}
%	If for $w(i,j)\equiv0$, boundary condition $(X_{0},\varGamma_{0})$, the following formulation holds:
%	\begin{equation}
%	\lim\limits_{i+j\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\{\|x(i,j)\|^{2}\} = 0
%	\end{equation}
%	then the 2D Markov jump system \eqref{system-equation} is said to be asymptotically mean square stable.
%	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}\label{H_infty-performance}
		Given a scalar $\gamma>0$, the 2D Markov jump system \eqref{system-equation} is said to be asymptotically mean square stable with an $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma$ if the system satisfies \eqref{AMSS}, and under zero boundary condition, the following holds:
		\begin{equation} \label{invDef2}
			\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\mathbb\{\|y(i,j)\|^{2}\} <  \gamma^{2} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\mathbb\{\|w(i,j)\|^{2}\}
		\end{equation}
		for all $w(i,j)\in\ell_{2}\{[0,\infty),[0,\infty)\}$.
	\end{definition}
	
	Now, we will make some notational simplification for convenience. The parameter $r(i,j)$ is represented by $k$, $r(i+1,j)$ and $r(i,j+1)$ are represented by $\tau$, $\sigma(i,j)$ is represented by $s$. 
	
	
	
	 The objective of this work is to devise an asynchronous  SMC law $u(i,j)$, such that the 2D Markov jump system \eqref{system-equation} is asymptotically mean square stable with an $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma$. 

\section{Main Result}

\subsection{ Sliding surface and sliding mode controller} \label{sliding-surface}
	In this paper, a novel Two-dimensional sliding surface function is constructed as follows: 
	\begin{equation}\label{siding-surface-equation}	
		s(i,j) = \begin{bmatrix}
					s^{h}(i,j)\\
					s^{v}(i,j)
					\end{bmatrix}
			   = Gx(i,j)
	\end{equation}
	where $G=\sum_{k=1}^{N_{1}}\beta_{k}G^{T}_{k}$, and scalars $\beta_{k}$ should be chosen such that $GB_{k}$ is nonsingular for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$. Based on the the assumption that $B_{k}$ is full column rank for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$, we can find that the above condition can be guaranteed easily with the properly selected parameter $\beta_{k}$. 
%	by selecting parameter $\beta_{k}$ properly. 
 	
 	An asynchronous 2D-SMC law is designed as follows:
	\begin{equation}\label{smc-law}
		u(i,j) = K_{s}x(i,j)-\rho(i,j)\frac{s(i,j)}{\|s(i,j)\|}
	\end{equation}
	for any $s\in\mathcal{N}_{2}$, where the matrix $K_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_u\times n_x}$ with $n_x=n_h+n_v$ will be determined later, and the parameter $\rho(i,j)$ is given as
	\begin{equation}\label{varrho}
	\rho(i,j) = \varrho_{1}\|x(i,j)\| + \varrho_{2}\|w(i,j)\|
	\end{equation}
	with $\varrho_{1}=\max_{k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}} \{\delta_{k} \}$, $\varrho_{2} = \max_{k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}}\{\|(GB_{k})^{-1}GE_{k}\| \} $, and the parameter $\delta_{k}$ is given in \eqref{nonlinear-func}. 
	
	Combining system \eqref{system-equation} and the asynchronous 2D-SMC low \eqref{siding-surface-equation}, the closed-loop 2D markov jump system can be obtained easily as follows:
%	\begin{equation} \label{closed-loop-system-equation}
%	\left\{
%	\begin{array}{lr}
%	\begin{split}
%	\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} = \bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)
%	\end{split}\\
%	\begin{split}
%	y(i,j) = C_{k}x(i,j)+D_{k}w(i,j)
%	\end{split}
%	\end{array}
%	\right.
%	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} \label{closed-loop-system-equation}
	\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} = \bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)
	\end{equation}
	where $\bar{A}_{ks} = A_{k}+B_{k}K_{s}$, and $\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)$ as follows
	\begin{equation*}
	\bar\rho_{k}(i,j)=f_{k}(x(i,j))-(\varrho_{1}\|x(i,j)\|+\varrho_{2}\|w(i,j)\|)\cdot\frac{s(i,j)}{\|s(i,j)\|}.
	\end{equation*}
	Then, based on the properties of norm, the following condition can be deduced easily
	\begin{equation}\label{norm-rho-inequality}
	\|\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\| \leq (\varrho_{1}+\delta_{k})\|x(i,j)\| + \varrho_{2}\|w(i,j)\| .
	\end{equation} 
		
\subsection{Analysis of Stability and $H_{\infty}$ attenuation performance } \label{stability&H_infty}
 In this subsection, we focus on the stability and $H_{\infty}$ attenuation performance analysis for the closed-loop 2D system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation}. A sufficient condition will be derived to guarantee the considered system is  asymptotically mean square stable with an $H_{\infty}$ attenuation performance $\gamma$.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem1}
	Consider the  Markov jump system \eqref{system-equation} under the Assumption \eqref{boundary-assumptin} and with the asynchronous 2D-SMC law \eqref{smc-law}. For a given scalar $\gamma>0$, if there exist matrices $K_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_u\times n_x}$,  $R_{k}=\mathrm{diag}\{R^{h}_{k},R^{v}_{k}\}>0$,  $Q_{ks}>0$, $T_{ks}>0$ and scalars $\epsilon_{k}>0$, for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}, s\in\mathcal{N}_{2}$,  such that the following inequalities hold: 
	\begin{equation}\label{T1C1}
	B^{T}_{k}  	\mathcal{R}_{k} B_{k} -\epsilon_{k}I \leq 0
	\end{equation},
	\begin{equation}\label{T1C2}
	\mathcal{A} +2\Big(\sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks} \mathrm{diag}\{Q_{ks}, T_{ks}\}\Big) < 0
	\end{equation},
	\begin{equation}\label{T1C3}
	\hat{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\hat{A}_{ks} - \mathrm{diag}\{Q_{ks}, T_{ks}\} < 0
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
	\varPi_{1} & \varPi_{3}\\
	*&\varPi_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation*} with
	\begin{equation*} \label{varPi}
	\left\{
	\begin{array}{lr}
	\begin{split}
	\varPi_{1}&=-R_{k}+4(\delta_{k}+\varrho_{1})^{2}\epsilon_{k}I+C^{T}_{k}C_{k}\\
	\varPi_{2}&=-\gamma^{2}I+D^{T}_{k}D_{k}+4\varrho_{2}^{2}\epsilon_{k}I\\
	\varPi_{3}&= C_{k}^{T}D_{k}\\
	\end{split}
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\end{equation*}
	and $\mathcal{R}_{k}=\sum_{\tau=1}^{N1}\lambda_{k\tau}R_{\tau}$, $\hat{A}_{ks}=\begin{bmatrix}
	\bar{A}_{ks}& E_{k}
	\end{bmatrix}$, 
	then, the closed-loop system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} is asymptotically mean square stable with an $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
	Let's start the proof with the stability of system. We select the Lyapunov candidate as $V_{1}(i,j) = x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)$, then, define
	\begin{equation}\label{VAR-DELTA-V1}
	\varDelta V_{1}(i,j) = \emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}}^{T}R_{\tau}\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} - x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)
	\end{equation}
	Based on the closed-loop system equation \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} with $w(i,j)=0$, it is easy to find that
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j) \}\\
	&=  \sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\Big\{\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\big]^{T}\mathcal{R}_{k}\\
	&\times\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\big]\Big\}\\
	&- x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j) \\
	&\leq x^{T}(i,j) \Big\{2\big(\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}(i,j)\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}\big)\Big\}x(i,j)\\ &+2\bar{\rho}^{T}_{k}(i,j)B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j) \\
	&-  x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Recalling the conditions given in \eqref{norm-rho-inequality} and \eqref{T1C1}, the following inequality can be further obtained
	\begin{equation}\label{combine-one-1}
	\begin{split}
		\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta  V_{1}(i,j) \} \leq x^{T}(i,j)\mathcal{G}_{ks}x(i,j)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathcal{G}_{ks}= 2\big(\sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}\big)
	+ 2\epsilon_{k}(\delta_{k}+\varrho_{1})^{2}I- R_{k}$.
	The following inequality can be deduced from \eqref{T1C2} based on the properties of  matrix quadratic
	\begin{equation}
	2\big(\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}Q_{ks}\big)+4\epsilon_{k}(\delta_{k}+\varrho_{1})^{2}I+C^{T}_{k}C_{k}-R_{k} < 0
	\end{equation}
	which will further deduce
	\begin{equation}\label{combine-one-2}
			2\big(\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}Q_{ks}\big)+2\epsilon_{k}(\delta_{k}+\varrho_{1})^{2}I-R_{k} < 0
	\end{equation}
	The following inequality can be  inferred directly from condition \eqref{T1C3} 
	\begin{equation}\label{combine-one-3}
		\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}-Q_{ks} < 0
	\end{equation}
	Combine \eqref{combine-one-2} and \eqref{combine-one-3}, we can infer that $\mathcal{G}_{ks}<0$, which is equivalent to 
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{G}_{ks} \leq -\alpha I
	\end{equation}
	with scalar $\alpha>0$.
	Recalling \eqref{combine-one-1}, we can further infer that
	\begin{equation}\label{VleqAlpha}
		\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j) \} \leq-\alpha \mathbb{E}\{\|x(i,j)\|^{2} \}
	\end{equation}
	Summing up on the both side of \eqref{VleqAlpha}, we have
	\begin{equation} \label{levE}
		\mathbb{E}\Big\{\sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}\sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}  \|x(i,j)\|^{2} \Big\} \leq -\frac{1}{\alpha} \mathbb{E}\Big\{\sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}\sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}  \varDelta V_{1}(i,j)  \Big\}
	\end{equation}
	where parameters $\kappa_{1}$, $\kappa_{2}$ are any positive integers. By substituting $\varDelta V_{1}$ and $R_{k}$ with \eqref{VAR-DELTA-V1} and $R_{k}=\mathrm{diag}\{R^{\rm{h}}_{k},R^{\rm{v}}_{k}\}$ respectively, we obtain
	\begin{equation} \label{Vhv}
		\begin{split}
			&\sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}\sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}  \varDelta V_{1}(i,j)\\&= \sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}\big\{V^{v}_{1}(i,\kappa_{2}+1) - V^{v}_{1}(i,0) \big\}\\
			&-  \sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}\big\{V^{h}_{1}(\kappa_{1}+1,j) - V^{h}_{1}(0,j) \big\}\\
			&\leq -\big( \sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}V^{v}_{1}(i,0) + \sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}V^{h}_{1}(0,j)\big) \\
%			&\leq -\beta \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \big(  \|x^{v}(\ell,0)\|^{2} + \|x^{h}(0,\ell)\|^{2} \big)
		\end{split}
	\end{equation} 
	where $V_{1}^{h}(i,j)$ and $V_{1}^{v}(i,j)$ are defined as   
	\begin{equation*}
	\left\{
	\begin{array}{lr}
	\begin{split}
	V^{h}_{1}(i,j)=x^{hT}(i,j)R^{h}_{r(i,j)}x^{h}(i,j)\\
	V^{v}_{1}(i,j)=x^{vT}(i,j)R^{v}_{r(i,j)}x^{v}(i,j)
	\end{split}
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\end{equation*}
	Recalling the boundary condition in Assumption \ref{boundary-assumptin}, and let $\kappa_{1}$, $\kappa_{2}$ tend to infinity, it follows from \eqref{levE} and \eqref{Vhv} that
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
		&\mathbb{E}\Big\{\sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}\sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}  \|x(i,j)\|^{2} \Big\} \\
		&\leq -\frac{\beta}{\alpha} \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \big(  \|x^{v}(\ell,0)\|^{2} + \|x^{h}(0,\ell)\|^{2} \big)\\
		&<\infty
		\end{split}	
	\end{equation}
	where $\beta$ is the maximum eigenvalue of $R^{h}(0,\ell)$ and $R^{v}(\ell,0)$, for any $\ell=0,1,2...$, which implies that \eqref{AMSS} holds. Thus, the asymptotically mean square stable of the considered system is proved. 
	
	Next, let's focus on the $H_{\infty}$ attenuation performance under zero boundary condition. Based on the closed-loop system equation \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation}, it is easy to find that
	\begin{equation}\label{DETAV1}
	\begin{split}
	&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j) \}\\
	&=  \sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\Big\{\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{p}w(i,j)\big]^{T}\\
	&\times \mathcal{R}_{k}\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{p}w(i,j)\big]\Big\}\\
	&- x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j) \\
	&\leq \hat{x}^{T}(i,j) \Big\{2\big(\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\hat{A}^{T}_{ks}(i,j)\mathcal{R}_{k}\hat{A}_{ks}\big)\Big\}\hat{x}(i,j)\\ &+2\bar{\rho}^{T}_{k}(i,j)B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j) \\
	&-  x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\\
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
%	where $\hat{x}(i,j)=\begin{bmatrix}
%		x(i,j)\\ w(i,j)
%	\end{bmatrix}$, $\hat{A}_{ks}(i,j)=\begin{bmatrix}
%		\bar{A}_{ks}&E_{k}
%	\end{bmatrix}$.
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		\hat{x}(i,j)=\begin{bmatrix}
		x(i,j)\\ w(i,j)
		\end{bmatrix},\ \hat{A}_{ks}(i,j)=\begin{bmatrix}
		\bar{A}_{ks}&E_{k}
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation*}
	Notice that from \eqref{norm-rho-inequality} and \eqref{T1C1}, we have
	\begin{equation}\label{invRho}
		\begin{split}
		 	&\bar{\rho}^{T}_{k}(i,j)B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\\
		 	&\leq 2\epsilon_{k}\big((\delta_{k}+\varrho_{1})^{2}\|x(i,j)\|^{2}+\varrho_{2}^{2}\|w(i,j)\|^{2} \big)
		\end{split}
	\end{equation} 
	The following condition can be deduced easily from \eqref{T1C2} and \eqref{T1C3}
	\begin{equation}\label{T1P4}
	\mathcal{\varXi}_{ks}<0
	\end{equation}	
	where $\mathcal{\varXi}_{ks} \equiv \mathcal{A} +2\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\hat{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\hat{A}_{ks}$. 
	Recalling the system \eqref{system-equation}, and substituting \eqref{invRho} into \eqref{DETAV1} yields
	\begin{equation}\label{DETAV1ZW}
		\begin{split}
			&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j)+\|y(i,j)\|^{2}-\gamma^{2}\|w(i,j)\|^{2}  \}\\
			&\leq \hat{x}^{T}(i,j)\mathcal{\varXi}_{ks} \hat{x}(i,j)<0
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Noting \eqref{Vhv} with the zero boundary condition, we can infer that
	\begin{equation} \label{Vhv2}
	\begin{split}
	&\sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}\sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}  \varDelta V_{1}(i,j)\\
	&=\sum_{i=0}^{\kappa_{1}}V^{v}_{1}(i,\kappa_{2}+1) + \sum_{j=0}^{\kappa_{2}}V^{h}_{1}(\kappa_{1}+1,j) \\
	&\geq 0 \qquad \forall \kappa_{1},\kappa_{2} = 1,2,3...
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Then, we can further deduce from \eqref{DETAV1ZW} and \eqref{Vhv2} that 
	\begin{equation}\label{DETAV1ZW2}
	\begin{split}
	&\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}  \mathbb{E}\{\|y(i,j)\|^{2}-\gamma^{2}\|w(i,j)\|^{2}  \}\\
	&\leq \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}  \mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j)+\|y(i,j)\|^{2}-\gamma^{2}\|w(i,j)\|^{2}  \}  \\
	&< 0
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	which implies \eqref{invDef2} holds. And this completes the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem1}.
	
	
\end{proof}

\subsection{Analysis of reachability}\label{minimization} 
	 The reachability of the  designed asynchronous 2D-SMC low for the closed-loop system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} will be discussed in this subsection. By using a stochastic Lyapunov method, we provide a sufficient condition which will confirm that the designed asynchronous 2D-SMC law \eqref{smc-law} can force the state trajectories of the closed-loop system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} into a time-varying sliding region around the specified 2D sliding surface \eqref{siding-surface-equation}.
	 

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem2}	
	Consider the closed-loop 2D Markov jump system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} with asynchronous 2D-SMC law \eqref{smc-law}. If there exists matrices $K_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_u\times n_x}$, $R_{k}>0$, $F_{k}>0$, and  scalars $\epsilon_{k}>0$, for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}, s\in\mathcal{N}_{2}$, such that the condition \eqref{T1C1} and the following inequality hold
	\begin{equation} \label{T2C1}
		2\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}} \bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\big(\mathcal{R}_{k}+G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}G\big)\bar{A}_{ks}-R_{k} <0
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathcal{R}_{k}$ is defined in Theorem \ref{theorem1}, and $\mathcal{F}_{k}=\sum_{\tau=1}^{N_{1}}\lambda_{k\tau}F_{\tau}$. Then, the state trajectories of the considered closed-loop system will be driven into the following sliding region $\mathcal{O}$, around the predefined sliding surface \eqref{siding-surface-equation}:
	\begin{equation}\label{smc-region}
		\mathcal{O}\equiv\Big\{\|s(i,j)\|\leq\ \rho^{*}(i,j) \Big\}
	\end{equation} 
	where $\rho^{*}(i,j) = \mathrm{max}_{k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}}\sqrt{\hat{\rho}_{k}(i,j)/
	\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(F_{k})}$ with
	\begin{equation*}
		 \begin{split}
		 	\hat{\rho}_{k}(i,j)&=4\big(\|E^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}E_{k}\|+ \|E^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{R}_{k}GE_{k}\|\\
		 	&+2\varrho_{2}^{2}(\|B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{F}_{k}B_{k}\|+ \|B^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}GB_{k}\| )\big)\|w(i,j)\|^{2}\\
		 	&+8\big(\|B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{T}B_{k}\|+\|B^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{R}_{T}GB_{k}\|\big)\\ &\times(\varrho_{1}+\delta_{k})^{2}\|x(i,j)\|^{2}.
		 \end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	and $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(F_{k})$ here denotes the minimum eigenvalue of $F_{k}$.
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof} 
	First, let's define $\emph{\textbf{s(i, j)}} = \begin{bmatrix}
	s^{h}(i+1,j)\\ s^{v}(i,j+1)
	\end{bmatrix}$,  it is easy find that $\emph{\textbf{s(i, j)}}=G\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}}$.  Then, we select the Lyapunov candidate as
	\begin{equation}
		V(i,j)=V_{1}(i,j)+V_{2}(i,j)
	\end{equation}
	where $V_{1}(i,j)$ is defined in Theorem \ref{theorem1}, $V_{2}(i,j)=s^{T}(i,j)F_{k}s(i,j)$. Similar with the proof in Theorem \ref{theorem1}, it is easy to find that
	\begin{equation} \label{P2T1}
		\begin{split}
			&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j) \}\\
			&=\mathbb{E}\Big\{\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}}^{T}R_{\tau}\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} - x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\Big\}\\
			&=  \sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\Big\{\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]^{T}\\
			&\times\mathcal{R}_{k} \big[ \bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]\Big\}\\
			&-x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\\
			&\leq 2x^{T}(i,j)\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j) \\
			&+2\big[B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]^{T}\mathcal{R}_{k}\\
			&\times\big[B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]\\
			&-x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\\
			&\leq 2x^{T}(i,j)\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j) \\
			&+ \bar{\rho}^{T}_{k}(i,j)B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\\
			&+w^{T}(i,j)E^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}E_{k}w(i,j)\\
			&-x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)
%&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{1}(i,j) \}\\
%=&\mathbb{E}\Big\{\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}}^{T}R_{\tau}\emph{\textbf{x(i, j)}} - x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\Big\}\\
%=&  \sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\Big\{\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]^{T}\\
%\times&\mathcal{R}_{k} \big[ \bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]\Big\}\\
%-&x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\\
%\leq& 2x^{T}(i,j)\sum_{s=1}^{K_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j) \\
%+&2\big[B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]^{T}\mathcal{R}_{k}\\
%\times&\big[B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]\\
%-&x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)\\
%\leq& 2x^{T}(i,j)\sum_{s=1}^{K_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j) \\
%+& \bar{\rho}^{T}_{k}(i,j)B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\\
%+&w^{T}(i,j)E^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}E_{k}w(i,j)\\
%-&x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j)
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Along with the sliding function in \eqref{siding-surface-equation}, we have
	\begin{equation} \label{P2T2}
		\begin{split}
			&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V_{2}(i,j) \}\\
			&=\mathbb{E}\Big\{\emph{\textbf{s(i, j)}}^{T}F_{\tau}\emph{\textbf{s(i, j)}} - s^{T}(i,j)F_{k}s(i,j)\Big\}\\
			&=  \sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\Big\{\big[\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]^{T}\\
			&\times G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k} G\big[ \bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j)+B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]\Big\}\\
			&-s^{T}(i,j)F_{k}s(i,j)\\
			&\leq 2x^{T}(i,j)\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}G\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j) \\
			&+2\big[B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]^{T}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}\\
			&\times G\big[B_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)+E_{k}w(i,j)\big]\\
			&-s^{T}(i,j)F_{k}s(i,j)\\
			&\leq 2x^{T}(i,j)\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}G\bar{A}_{ks}x(i,j) \\
			&+ \bar{\rho}^{T}_{k}(i,j)B^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}GB_{k}\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\\
			&+w^{T}(i,j)E^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}GE_{k}w(i,j)\\
			&-s^{T}(i,j)F_{k}s(i,j)
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Combing \eqref{P2T1} and \eqref{P2T2}, we can infer that 
	\begin{equation}\label{P2T3}
		\begin{split}
				&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V(i,j) \}\\
				&= \mathbb{E}\Big\{\varDelta_{1}(i,j)+\varDelta V_{2}(i,j) \Big\}\\
				&\leq x^{T}(i,j)\Big\{ 2\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\big(\mathcal{R}_{k} +G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}G\big)\bar{A}_{ks} \Big\} x(i,j) \\
				& +\vec{\rho}_{k}(i,j)-x^{T}(i,j)R_{k}x(i,j) - \lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(F_{k})\|s(i,j)\|^{2}\\
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
			&\vec{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\\
			&= 4\big(\|B^{T}_{k}\mathcal{F}_{k}B_{k}\|+ \|B^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}GB_{k}\|\big) \|\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\|^{2} \\
			&+ 4\big(\|E^{T}_{k}\mathcal{R}_{k}E_{k}\|+ \|E^{T}_{k}G^{T}\mathcal{R}_{k}GE_{k}\|\big) \|w(i,j)\|^{2} 
		\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	Recalling the condition \eqref{norm-rho-inequality}, we can get an inequality as follows
	\begin{equation}\label{rholeseq}
		\|\bar{\rho}_{k}(i,j)\|^{2} \leq 2(\varrho_{1}+\delta_{k})^{2}\|x(i,j)\|^{2} +2\varrho_{2}^{2}\|w(i,j\|^{2} 
	\end{equation}	  
	It is obvious that $\vec{\rho}_{k}(i,j) < \hat{\rho}_{k}(i,j) $ for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$ after substitute \eqref{rholeseq} into $\vec{\rho}_{k}(i,j)$. 
	Then, based on the condition \eqref{T1C2}, when the state trajectories is out of the region $\mathcal{O}$ around the specified siding surface \eqref{siding-surface-equation}, we can infer that
	\begin{equation}\label{P2T5}
		-\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(F_{k})\|s(i,j)\|^{2} + \vec{\rho}_{k}(i,j) <0
	\end{equation}
	It yields from \eqref{T2C1}, \eqref{P2T1}, \eqref{P2T3} and \eqref{P2T5} that 
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			&\mathbb{E}\{\varDelta V(i,j) \}\\
			&\leq x^{T}(i,j)\Big\{ 2\sum_{s=1}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\bar{A}^{T}_{ks}\big(\mathcal{R}_{k} +G^{T}\mathcal{F}_{k}G \big)\bar{A}_{ks}\\ &-R_{k} \Big\} x(i,j)<0
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	which means the state trajectories of the close-loop \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} are strictly decreasing (with mean square) outside the region $\mathcal{O}$ defined in \eqref{smc-region}. Now, the proof is complete.
	 
\end{proof}

It is obvious that, if the theorem \ref{theorem1} and the theorem \ref{theorem2} hold simultaneously, then, the asymptotically mean square stability  with an $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma$ of the closed-loop 2D system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} and the reachability of the predefined sliding function \eqref{siding-surface-equation} can be guaranteed simultaneously. That is, the to be determined matrix $K_{s}$ in 2D-SMC law \eqref{smc-law} should ensure that theorem \ref{theorem1}, \ref{theorem2} are established at the same time. Now, in this subsection, we will continue our study with this idea.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem3}
	Consider the  Markov jump system \eqref{system-equation} under the Assumption \eqref{boundary-assumptin} and with the asynchronous 2D-SMC law \eqref{smc-law}.  For a given scalar $\gamma>0$, if there exist matrices $\tilde{K}_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_u\times n_x}$, $L_{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_x\times n_x}$, $\tilde{R}_{k}=\mathrm{diag}\{\tilde{R}^{h}_{k},\tilde{R}^{v}_{k}\}>0$, $\tilde{F}_{k}>0$,  $\tilde{Q}_{ks}>0$, $\tilde{T}_{ks}>0$ and scalars $\tilde{\epsilon}_{k}>0$, for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}, s\in\mathcal{N}_{2}$,  such that the following inequalities hold: 
	\begin{equation} \label{T3C1}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			-\tilde{\epsilon}_{k}I &\mathscr{B}_{k}\\
			*& \mathscr{R}_{k}
		\end{bmatrix} < 0
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation} \label{T3C2}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\mathscr{L}_{ks}&\mathscr{A}_{ks}&\mathscr{G}_{ks}\\
			*&\mathscr{R}_{k}&0\\
			*&*&\mathscr{F}_{k}\\
		\end{bmatrix}<0
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}\label{T3C3}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\mathscr{H}_{k}&\mathscr{D}_{k}&\mathscr{P}_{ks}&\mathscr{Y}_{ks}\\
			*&\mathscr{I}_{k}&0&0\\
			*&*&\mathscr{Q}_{ks}&0\\
			*&*&*&\mathscr{T}_{ks}\\
		\end{bmatrix} <0
	\end{equation}
	where 
	\begin{equation}\notag
		\begin{split}
			\mathscr{B}_{k}&= \begin{bmatrix}
				\sqrt{\lambda_{k1}}\tilde{\epsilon}_{k}B^{T}_{k}&\sqrt{\lambda_{k2}}\tilde{\epsilon}_{k}B^{T}_{k}&\cdots&\sqrt{\lambda_{kN_{1}}}\tilde{\epsilon}_{k}B^{T}_{k}
			\end{bmatrix}\\
			\mathscr{R}_{k}&= \mathrm{diag}\{-\tilde{R}_{1}, -\tilde{R}_{2}, \cdots, -\tilde{R}_{N_{1}} \} \\
			\mathscr{F}_{k}&= \mathrm{diag}\{-\tilde{F}_{1}, -\tilde{F}_{2}, \cdots, -\tilde{F}_{N_{1}} \} \\	
			\mathscr{I}_{k} &= \mathrm{diag}\{-\tilde{\epsilon}_{k}, -I, -I, -\tilde{\epsilon}_{k} \}\\	
			\mathscr{Q}_{ks}&= \mathrm{diag}\{-\tilde{Q}_{k1}, -\tilde{Q}_{k2}, \cdots, -\tilde{Q}_{kN_{2}} \}\\
			\mathscr{T}_{ks}&= \mathrm{diag}\{-\tilde{T}_{k1}, -\tilde{T}_{k2}, \cdots, -\tilde{T}_{kN_{2}} \}\\
			\mathscr{L}_{ks}&= \mathrm{diag}\{\tilde{Q}_{ps}-L^{T}_{s}-L_{s},  -\tilde{T}_{ks} \}\\
%			\begin{bmatrix}
%				\tilde{Q}_{ps}-L^{T}_{s}-L_{s}&0\\
%				*&-\tilde{T}_{ks}
%			\end{bmatrix}, \
			\mathscr{H}_{k} &= \begin{bmatrix}
				-\tilde{R}_{k} & \tilde{R}C^{T}_{k}D^{T}_{k}\\
				*& -\gamma^{2}I
			\end{bmatrix} \\
			\mathscr{A}_{ks} &=\begin{bmatrix}
				\sqrt{\lambda_{k1}} \tilde{A}^{T}_{ks}& \cdots&\sqrt{\lambda_{kN_{1}}} \tilde{A}^{T}_{ks}\\
				\sqrt{\lambda_{k1}}\tilde{T}_{ks}B^{T}_{k} &\cdots&\sqrt{\lambda_{kN_{1}}} \tilde{T}_{ks}B^{T}_{k}\\
			\end{bmatrix} \\
			\mathscr{G}_{ks} &=\begin{bmatrix}
				\sqrt{\lambda_{k1}} \tilde{A}^{T}_{ks}G^{T}& \cdots&\sqrt{\lambda_{kN_{1}}} \tilde{A}^{T}_{ks}G^{T}\\
				0  &\cdots& 0
			\end{bmatrix}\\
			\mathscr{D}_{ks} &= \begin{bmatrix}
				2(\varrho_{1}+ \delta_{k} )\tilde{R}_{k}& \tilde{R}_{k}C^{T}_{k}&0&0\\
				0&0&D^{T}_{k}&2\varrho_{2} \\
			\end{bmatrix} \\	
			\mathscr{P}_{ks} &= \begin{bmatrix}
				\sqrt{2\mu_{k1}} \tilde{R}_{k} &\cdots &\sqrt{2\mu_{kN_{2}}} \tilde{R}_{k}\\
				0 & \cdots & 0\\
			\end{bmatrix}	\\
			\mathscr{Y}_{ks} &= \begin{bmatrix}
				0 & \cdots & 0\\
				\sqrt{2\mu_{k1}} I &\cdots &\sqrt{2\mu_{kN_{2}}} I\\
			\end{bmatrix}	\\						
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	and $\tilde{A}_{ks} =  A_{k}L_{s} + B_{k}\tilde{K}_{s}$. Then,  the closed-loop system \eqref{closed-loop-system-equation} is asymptotically mean square stable with an $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma$, and the state trajectories of the considered closed-loop system will be driven into a sliding region $\mathcal{O}$, around the predefined sliding surface \eqref{siding-surface-equation}. Moreover, the to be determined matrix $K_{s}$ in 2D-SMC law \eqref{smc-law} can be chosen as 
	\begin{equation}
		K_{s} = \tilde{K}_{s}L^{-1}_{s}
	\end{equation}
	if the LMIs \eqref{T3C1}, \eqref{T3C2} and \eqref{T3C3} have feasible solutions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	As we discussed above, the objective is to testify that, the conditions \eqref{T1C1}, \eqref{T1C2}, \eqref{T1C3} in Theorem \ref{theorem1} and \eqref{T2C1} in Theorem \ref{theorem2}  can be guaranteed simultaneously by \eqref{T3C1}, \eqref{T3C2}, \eqref{T3C3}. Before that, let's make some notations as $\tilde{K}_{s}=K_{s}L_{s}$, $\tilde{R}_{k}=R^{-1}_{k}$, $\tilde{F}_{k}=F^{-1}_{k}$, $\tilde{Q}_{ks}=Q^{-1}_{ks}$, $\tilde{T}_{ks}=T^{-1}_{ks}$ and  $\tilde{\epsilon}=\epsilon^{-1}_{k}$. 
	Firstly, we will prove that \eqref{T1C1} and \eqref{T3C1} are equivalent. Pre- and post- multiplying the inequalities given in \eqref{T3C1} by $\mathrm{diag}\{\epsilon_{k}I, I,I,\cdots,I \}$, respectively, and applying  Schur complement after that, then, we can see \eqref{T1C1} satisfied.  
	Next, we will verity that \eqref{T3C2} and \eqref{T3C3} are sufficient  to ensure \eqref{T1C2}, \eqref{T1C3} and \eqref{T2C1} hold simultaneously.  Using $\mathrm{diag}\{R_{k}, I ,I,\cdots, I \}$  to pre- and post-multiply the inequality given in \eqref{T3C3}, and applying Schur complement after that, then we will have \eqref{T1C2} satisfied.  
	It follows from  \eqref{T3C2} that $\tilde{Q}_{ps}-L^{T}_{s}-L_{s}<0$, that is $L^{T}_{s}+L_{s} $ is positive definite, which guarantees that the matrix  $L_{s}$ is invertible. We can infer the following formulation based on $Q_{ps}>0$
	\begin{equation}
		(\tilde{Q}_{ps} - L_{s} )^{T}\tilde{Q}^{-1}_{ks}(\tilde{Q}_{ps} - L_{s} )\geq 0
	\end{equation}
	which means 
	\begin{equation}
		-L^{T}_{s}\tilde{Q}_{ks}L_{s} \leq  \tilde{Q}_{ps}-L^{T}_{s}-L_{s}
	\end{equation}
	Recalling the condition give in \eqref{T3C3}, then we can infer that
	 \begin{equation} \label{ls2}
	 	\begin{bmatrix}
	 	\tilde{\mathscr{L}}_{ks}&\mathscr{A}_{ks}&\mathscr{G}_{ks}\\
	 	*&\mathscr{R}_{k}&0\\
	 	*&*&\mathscr{F}_{k}\\
	 	\end{bmatrix}<0
	 \end{equation}
	 where $\tilde{\mathscr{L}}_{ks}= \mathrm{diag}\{-L^{T}_{s}\tilde{Q}_{ks}L_{s},  -\tilde{T}_{ks} \}$. \\
	 Noting that the slack matrix $L_{s}$ is invertible, we denote $h_{ks}= \mathrm{diag}\{L^{-1}_{s}, T_{ks}, I, I,\cdots, I \}$. Using $h_{ks}$ to  pre- and post-multiply the inequality given in \eqref{ls2}, and applying Schur complement after that, then the following inequality will be obtained
	 \begin{equation} \label{ls3}
	 	\hat{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\hat{A}_{ks} + \check{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{F}_{k}\check{A}_{ks}  - \mathrm{diag}\{Q_{ks}, T_{ks}\} < 0  
	 \end{equation}
	 where $\check{A}_{ks}=\begin{bmatrix}
	 \bar{A}_{ks}&0
	 \end{bmatrix}$. Combing \eqref{T1C2} and \eqref{ls3},  we will have
	 \begin{equation}
	 	\mathcal{A} +2\sum_{s=0}^{N_{2}}\mu_{ks}\Big\{ \hat{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{R}_{k}\hat{A}_{ks} + \check{A}^{T}_{ks}\mathcal{F}_{k}\check{A}_{ks} \Big\} < 0
	 \end{equation}
	 which further implies \eqref{T2C1} holds based on the property of positive definite matrix. It is clear that, the gain matrix $K_{s}$ can not obtained directly from LMIs in Theorem \ref{theorem3} while $\tilde{K}_{s}$ is obtained. Thanks to the matrix $L_{s}$ is invertible, $K_{s}$ can be calculated indirectly with $K_{s}=\tilde{K}_{s}L^{-1}_{s}$. Now, the proof is finished.
\end{proof}
	It is clear that, the conditions in Theorem \ref{theorem3} are presented in the form of Linear matrix inequality, which can be easily solved with the help of Matlab LMI toolbox. Next, we are going to propose an algorithm to obtain the asynchronous 2D-SMC law with the minimum disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma^{*}$. The design procedures of the algorithm are summarized as follows.
	
	1. Select the parameters $\beta_{k}$ properly and compute matrix $G$, such that the matrix $GB_{k}$ is nonsingular for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$. 
	
	2. Compute the scalars $\varrho_{1}$ and $\varrho_{2}$ in \eqref{varrho}. 

	3. Get the matrices  $\tilde{K}_{s}$ and $L_{s}$ by solving the  following optimization problem
	\begin{equation}\label{optimization-problem}
		\text{min $\tilde{\sigma}$ subject to \eqref{T3C1}-\eqref{T3C3} with $\tilde\sigma=\gamma^{2}$ }.
	\end{equation}
	
	4. Then, the sliding mode controller matrix $K_s$ can be obtained with $K_{s}= \tilde{K}_{s}L^{-1}_{s}$.











\section{Numerical Example} \label{example}
In this section, we provide an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous 2D-SMC law design method.  It is known that some dynamical processes, for instance, gas absorption, air drying and  water stream heating  can be described by the Darboux equation \cite{darboux-equation}. It is generally described in the form of partial differential equation, and can be easily converted into  a 2D Markov jump system in Roesser model with a similar approach applied in \cite{du-chunling&l-xie}. The considered 2D Markov jump system and the asynchronous  2D-SMC law both consist of two operation modes, that is, $\mathcal{N}_1=\{1,2\}$, $ \mathcal{N}_{2}=\{1,2\}$,  and the corresponding system matrices are listed  as follows: \\
Mode 1:
\begin{equation} \notag
\begin{aligned}
	A_{1} &= \begin{bmatrix}
	-1.0&0.4\\
	0.2&-1.0
	\end{bmatrix}, \ 
	B_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.2&0.1\\ -0.2&-0.3
	\end{bmatrix} ,\ 
	D_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
		-0.1\\0
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	C_{1} &= \begin{bmatrix}
		0.1&-0.1\\-0.2&0.1
	\end{bmatrix},\ 
	E_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
		-0.1\\ 0.1
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}  
\end{equation}
Mode 2:
\begin{equation} \notag
\begin{aligned}
A_{2} &=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.8&0.6\\
0.2&-1.2
\end{bmatrix}, \ 
B_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
0.2&-0.2\\ -0.1&-0.2
\end{bmatrix} ,\ 
D_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
-0.1\\0.2
\end{bmatrix} \\
C_{2} &= \begin{bmatrix}
-0.2&-0.1\\0.1&0.2
\end{bmatrix},\
E_{2} = E_{1}
\end{aligned}  
\end{equation}
The nonlinear function $f(x(i,j),r(i,j))$ is set as
\begin{equation*}
	f((x(i,j),r(i,j)) = \begin{cases}
	0.2\sin{ \|x(i,j)\|}, \quad \ r(i,j)=1\\
	0.3\sin{ \|x(i,j)\|}, \quad \ r(i,j)=2
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the parameter $\delta_{k}$ can be selected as first mode with $\delta_{1}=0.2$  and  second mode with $\delta_{2}=0.3$.\\
The mode jumps of the considered 2D system and 2D-SMC law are governed by the transition probability matrix  $\varLambda$ and $\varPsi$, respectively, which are set as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
	\varLambda=\begin{bmatrix}
	0.8&0.2\\ 0.3&0.7
	\end{bmatrix}, \ 
	\varPsi = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.6&0.4\\ 0.4 &0.6
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

	\caption{Modes of the 2D-SMC law}

\end{figure}
A possible time sequences with two different directions of the system modes and the asynchronous 2D-SMC law modes are depicted in Fig.\ref{fig1} and Fig.\ref{fig2}, respectively. By comparison, it is clear that the designed 2D-SMC law run asynchronously with the original 2D system.  \\
Based on the corresponding assumptions, the boundary condition $X_{0}$ and  the exogenous disturbance $w(i,j)$ are assumed to be
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
	x^{h}(0, j)&=\begin{cases}
		0.1, \quad 0\leq j \leq 10 \\
		0, \quad \ \ elsewhere
	\end{cases} \\
	x^{v}(i, 0)&=\begin{cases}
	0.1, \quad 0\leq i \leq 10 \\
	0, \quad \ \ elsewhere
	\end{cases}\\
	w(i, j)\ &=\begin{cases}
	0.2, \quad 0\leq i,j \leq 10 \\
	0, \quad \ \ elsewhere
	\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\end{figure}
 The horizontal and vertical state responses of the open-loop system in \eqref{system-equation} under $u(i,j) = 0$ are depicted in Fig.\ref{fig3} and Fig.\ref{fig4}, respectively. The obtained result implies the considered 2D system is unstable under zero control input. 
Next, let's follow the procedures of asynchronous 2D-SMC law design algorithm, and obtain the sliding model controller gain. 
Letting $\beta_{1}=0.6$ and $\beta_{2}=0.4$, and the  matrix $G$ can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
G=\begin{bmatrix}
0.2&-0.02\\
0.16&-0.26
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
It's easy to verify that the non-singularity of the matrix $GB_{k}$ is satisfied for any $k\in\mathcal{N}_{1}$. The parameters $\varrho_{1}$ and $\varrho_{2}$ can be calculated as $\varrho_{1}=0.3$ and $\varrho_{2}=0.6872$, respectively. By solving optimization problem \eqref{optimization-problem}, we can obtain the following sliding mode controller gains\\
Mode1
\begin{equation*}
 	K_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}
 	4.4148 &-4.3508\\
 	-0.6827& -2.1887
 	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Mode2
\begin{equation*}
K_{2} = 	\begin{bmatrix}
4.3707 &  -3.8450 \\
-0.6826 &  -2.3252\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
with the minimum $H_{\infty}$ disturbance attenuation performance $\gamma^{*}=0.3164$. \\
